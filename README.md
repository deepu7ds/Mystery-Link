## Introduction
In the digital age, secure and private communication is crucial. Indeed, there are many platforms that facilitate interaction between individuals, but concerns about privacy, data security, and identity protection remain prevalent. 

**MysteryLnk** is an innovative application designed to address these concerns by allowing people to generate *links* that others can use to ask questions without exposing personal details or compromising privacy. 

This report delves into the functionality of **MysteryLnk**, its integration with data privacy practices, and its use of cryptographic techniques to ensure secure communication.

## Problem Statement
In our creation of **MysteryLnk**, we have assumed the problem statement to be the following:

> Create an application that allows users to receive anonymous public messages from their friends and peers, as a sort of fun social experiment.


## Key Features of MysteryLnk

1. **Anonymous Query Links**  
    MysteryLnk enables users to generate unique, one-time-use links that others can follow to ask questions. The identity of the person asking the question remains hidden, and no personal information is shared during the process. This feature fosters an environment of trust and openness while maintaining anonymity.
    
2. **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)**  
    At the core of MysteryLnk's security model is its use of end-to-end encryption (E2EE). This ensures that the contents of the messages sent through the platform are only accessible to the intended recipient. Neither MysteryLnk nor any third-party services can read or intercept the communication. The application uses industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect the data in transit and at rest, ensuring that the questions and responses are securely exchanged.
    
3. **Temporary Data Retention**  
    To further safeguard privacy, MysteryLnk adopts a temporary data retention policy. The questions and responses exchanged via the platform are stored on the server only for a limited period, after which they are automatically deleted. This policy minimizes the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to historical communications.
    
4. **One-Time Use Links**  
    Each link generated by MysteryLnk is designed for one-time use, ensuring that the same link cannot be reused or exploited for multiple queries. This mechanism reduces the risk of phishing attacks or the unintended disclosure of sensitive information.
    
5. **Customizable Privacy Settings**  
    Users of MysteryLnk have the ability to customize the privacy settings of the links they generate. Options include limiting who can access the link, restricting the duration for which the link remains active, and specifying whether the user must be authenticated before asking a question. These features give users greater control over their privacy and security.
    

## Data Privacy in MysteryLnk

MysteryLnk prioritizes the protection of user data by adhering to the principles of data privacy and security. Below are the key privacy practices employed by the application:

1. **Minimal Data Collection**  
    MysteryLnk operates on the principle of minimal data collection. The platform does not require users to provide personal information unless necessary. For example, users generating a link do not need to share their name, email, or other identifying information unless they choose to enable certain features, such as email notifications for responses.
    
2. **Data Anonymization**  
    To protect both the questioners and the recipients, MysteryLnk anonymizes all data involved in the process. Users who submit questions remain anonymous unless they voluntarily disclose their identity. Additionally, any identifiable information related to the users is automatically removed from the communication logs after each session.
    
3. **GDPR and CCPA Compliance**  
    MysteryLnk is compliant with global data privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The platform allows users to request the deletion of their data, access any stored data, and control how their information is used.
    
4. **Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit**  
    Data encryption plays a pivotal role in MysteryLnkâ€™s privacy framework. In addition to using end-to-end encryption for questions and responses, the platform employs strong encryption algorithms to protect data at rest. This means that even if the servers were compromised, the encrypted data would remain inaccessible to unauthorized parties.
    

## Cryptography in MysteryLnk

Cryptography is the cornerstone of MysteryLnk's security infrastructure. The application leverages modern cryptographic techniques to safeguard data and ensure that all communications remain confidential and tamper-proof.

### 1. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

MysteryLnk uses Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to facilitate secure exchanges between users. When a user generates a link, the platform assigns a unique public-private key pair to that interaction. The public key is shared with the questioner, allowing them to encrypt their question before sending it. Only the recipient, holding the corresponding private key, can decrypt the message. This system ensures that even if the data were intercepted, it would be meaningless without the private key.

### 2. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**

To enhance the efficiency and strength of its encryption, MysteryLnk implements Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). ECC provides the same level of security as traditional encryption methods like RSA but with smaller key sizes. This allows MysteryLnk to offer robust encryption while minimizing computational overhead, enabling faster processing and reducing server load.

### 3. **Hashing for Data Integrity**

MysteryLnk uses cryptographic hashing to verify the integrity of the data transmitted through its platform. Each question and response is hashed using algorithms such as SHA-256, generating a fixed-length representation of the data. When the recipient receives the message, the hash can be recomputed and compared to ensure that the message has not been altered or tampered with during transmission.

### 4. **Symmetric Encryption for Temporary Data**

While end-to-end encryption protects the messages exchanged between users, MysteryLnk also uses symmetric encryption for temporary data storage. Before questions and responses are deleted from the servers, they are encrypted with a symmetric key that is unique to each session. This adds an additional layer of security, ensuring that even the temporary data stored on the server is protected.

## Security Measures and Threat Mitigation

MysteryLnk has implemented several security measures to protect users from common cyber threats, including:

- **Protection against Phishing and Spoofing:** By generating one-time-use, time-limited links, MysteryLnk reduces the risk of phishing attacks. Users cannot reuse old links, which helps to prevent malicious actors from impersonating trusted individuals.
    
- **Brute-Force Attack Resistance:** The cryptographic protocols used in MysteryLnk are resistant to brute-force attacks. The use of ECC and strong key sizes ensures that it would take an infeasible amount of time and computational power to crack the encryption protecting the data.
    
- **Session Expiry and Key Revocation:** For added security, MysteryLnk supports automatic session expiry and key revocation. After a predefined period or after the question has been answered, the cryptographic keys associated with the session are destroyed, rendering the data irrecoverable.
    

## Conclusion

MysteryLnk offers a unique, privacy-first solution for secure communication. By leveraging state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques and prioritizing data privacy, it creates an environment where users can confidently ask and answer questions without fear of compromising personal information. With its commitment to encryption, minimal data retention, and compliance with international privacy regulations, MysteryLnk sets a high standard for secure digital interactions.

As the importance of data privacy continues to grow, MysteryLnk exemplifies how applications can effectively integrate cryptography and data protection into their core functionality.
